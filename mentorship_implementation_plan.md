# Mentorship Module Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing the Mentorship Module in your SRKR Frappe application. The implementation integrates with the existing Exam Results feature to provide a comprehensive view of student performance.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (15-20 minutes)

1. **Verify Exam Results Feature**
   - Ensure the Semester Result and Subject Result DocTypes are created
   - Test the "Sync Exam Results" button on a Student form
   - Verify results are being saved correctly

2. **Add the API Function**
   - The `get_student_academic_summary` function has been added to api.py
   - This function fetches both attendance data and exam results

3. **Prepare the Setup Script**
   - The setup_mentorship_module.py script has been created
   - Review the script to understand what it will create

### Phase 2: Execute the Setup Script (10 minutes)

1. **Access the Frappe Console**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/frappe-bench
   bench --site your-site-name console
   ```

2. **Import and Run the Setup Script**
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/path/to/frappe-bench/apps/srkr-frappe-app-api')
   import setup_mentorship_module
   setup_mentorship_module.run_complete_mentorship_setup()
   ```

3. **Exit the Console**
   ```python
   exit()
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   bench migrate
   bench restart
   ```

### Phase 3: Verify and Test (15 minutes)

1. **Check DocTypes Creation**
   - Open the Frappe Desk
   - Navigate to "Education" module
   - Verify these DocTypes exist:
     - Student Mentorship Profile
     - Mentorship Log Entry
     - Mentorship Goals
     - Mentorship Activities

2. **Test the Student Mentorship Profile**
   - Open a Student Mentorship Profile
   - Navigate to the "Live Dashboard" tab
   - Verify the academic data loads correctly
   - Check that exam results are displayed

3. **Create a Test Mentorship Log**
   - Click the "Add Mentorship Log" button
   - Fill in required fields
   - Save the log
   - Verify it appears in the Connections dashboard

### Phase 4: Finalize Setup (5-10 minutes)

1. **Create Documentation**
   - Share the mentorship_module_guide.md with users
   - Schedule a brief training session

2. **Set User Permissions**
   - Ensure Instructors have the correct role assignments
   - Test access with different user accounts

## Common Issues and Solutions

### API Data Not Loading

**Problem**: The academic dashboard shows an error message or doesn't load data.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the student has an active Program Enrollment
2. Ensure Course Enrollments exist for the current term
3. Check if Semester Results have been synced
4. Look for errors in the bench.log file

### DocType Creation Errors

**Problem**: Setup script fails to create some DocTypes.

**Solutions**:
1. Check for conflicting DocType names
2. Ensure the user running the script has System Manager role
3. Try deleting any partially created DocTypes and run again

### Missing Connections

**Problem**: Mentorship Log entries don't show up in the Student Mentorship Profile.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the links were properly configured
2. Run the configure_mentorship_links() function separately
3. Verify both DocTypes have the correct field names

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Execute Phases 1-3
- **Day 2**: Execute Phase 4, conduct training
- **Days 3-5**: Monitor usage, address any issues

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered successful when:

1. All DocTypes are created and functioning properly
2. Academic data loads correctly in the dashboard
3. Mentors can create and track mentorship sessions
4. Student goals and activities can be recorded
5. Users can navigate the system without errors

## Support Plan

For technical issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in the guide
2. Review bench.log for specific error messages
3. Contact the development team if issues persist
